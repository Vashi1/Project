Among twenty snowy mountains,  The only moving thing   Was the eye of the blackbird.   I was of three minds,   Like a tree   In which there are three blackbirds.   The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.   It was a small part of the pantomime.   A man and a woman   Are one.   A man and a woman and a blackbird   Are one.   I do not know which to prefer,   The beauty of inflections   Or the beauty of innuendoes,
